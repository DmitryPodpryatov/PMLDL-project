# PMLDL Project Deliverable D1.2

**Student:** Dmitry Podpryatov  
  
**Group:** DS-02  
  
**Project:** Music Generation (Genre Mixing)

## Progress

So far, I have been researching the methods and specifics of the problem. I started from the online tutorials on music generation to get the general idea and approach on how to deal with the task.

I have collected the reasonable amount of tutorials on how to work with MIDI files and music, downloaded and investigated datasets listed in the previous part, and began working on the model. Links are listed in the [references](#references) section.

I have also been thinking on the strategy and the plan. It seems reasonable to progress as follows.
1. Learn how to generate music in general and implement basic model
2. Study available data, possible collect it by myself
3. Adapt the basic model for the obtained data
4. Test the results
