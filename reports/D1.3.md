## Progress

Last time I talked about the general approach related to the music generation.
It seems that most of the internet prefers to work with MIDI files, and while that is not a problem in general case, but 
there seem to exist only single-genre MIDI datasets.
So I researched a bit on the WAV-to-MIDI conversion, but as it turned out, 
WAV-to-MIDI conversion in general is a problem that is not fully solved at the moment, as [these](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2126233) gentlemen say.
Concluding, it is tough (read impossible) to find a middle ground dataset with labeled by genre MIDI files.

So during past weeks I tried to find a good enough solution to get started on the model.
The first problem on the way was the operating system: python inside Windows does not support reading midi files out of the box.
I tried a couple of libraries such as `midi2audio`, however they require sound fonts, which are not necessarily the friendliest
thing to the Windows file system.

So, I moved to the Ubuntu, which works fine with midi files, so now I am trying to figure
out the conversions.
`audio-to-midi` seemed like a good enough python solution, however I encountered problem with Cython compilation
in the dependencies, which I am trying to solve right now.
Moreover, it does not really generalize as it requires a BPM of the track to function properly.

Finally, I found a MIDI-less [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/henriquetheodor/entender-o-chromagram-e-encontrar-drop) on the Kaggle
in Portugal that manually converts frequencies to the notes, so I might give it a try.
