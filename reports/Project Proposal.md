## Introduction

Everyone loves music. And so do I. But writing music is difficult. People study whole their life to become famous, to give concerts and make a lot of money. However, very few actually succeed. To gain profit, producers make contracts with radio/film industries or publish their creations online to profit from ad revenue. 

Since the music, as any other art is a property, copyrighting applies here, and so it is prohibiter to use it in own projects. Unfortunately, controlling copyrighting is not easy. Large corporations such as google create smart algorithms and write regulations to hinder and detect copyright violations, but these algorithms are not perfect and contracts have holes, which means that creators suffer a lot from copyright claims. 

So what if we do not use human-created music at all... What if machines write music, even more, we can train machines to replicate authors and bands, and because this new music is not generated by a human, copyrights do not apply here.

Additionally, machine-generated music opens the room for experimenting, as it is easier and faster than writing from the scratch.

## Background

Numerous research has been done on the topic. Scientists have already experimented on the tools for music generation and analyzed the pros and cons of each method (Deep Learning Techniques for Music Generation - A Survey). Deep learning is considered as the way-to-go, and various architectures have been studied including feed-forward, recurrent neural networks.

## Methods & Data

The goal of the project is to experiment with different genres combinations. Various deep learning models and architectures will be compared both on the quality of the output and the learning time and resources.

There are many freely available music datasets across the internet. Just to name a few, Million Song Dataset contains data of the million pop music tracks with metadata and GTZAN Dataset contains the features for mapping between music encoding and genre.
